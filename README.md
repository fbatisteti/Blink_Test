# blink_test

A Flutter project for a job/internship application. Guidelines were to follow the official website's tutorial then modify it to show all of SÃ£o Paulo's cities (around 650 cities from Brazil) and add additional features if the coder felt like doing so.

There will be no further modifications on this repository.

Also, this is my first experience with Flutter... will work more on that, looks fun.
